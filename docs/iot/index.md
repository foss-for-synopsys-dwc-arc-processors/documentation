## embARC Board Support Package (BSP)

![Logo embARC](images/logo-embarc.png)

The embARC Board support Package (BSP) for DesignWare® ARC® EM Starter Kit
(EMSK) is a software distribution aimed at facilitating the development and
evaluation of embedded systems based on ARCv2 processors. It is designed to
provide a minimal board support package for ARC EMSK users by defining
consistent and simple software interfaces to the processors and onboard
devices.

## Toppers ASP

![Logo Toppers](images/logo-toppers.gif)

TOPPERS（Toyohashi OPen Platform for Embedded Real-time Systems）Project,
based on ITRON, is aimed at base software for use in embedded systems. The
TOPPERS/ASP kernel is the foundation for the new generation of TOPPERS
real-time kernels that follow the TOPPERS new generation kernel specification.
ASP (Advanced Standard Profile) has been developed by extending and improving
TOPPERS/JSP, a real-time kernel based on the standard profile of μITRON4.0.
Support for the ARC architecture is available below.
