## Overview

The ARC AXS103 Software Development Platform includes the AXC003 CPU Card and
supports the ARC HS34, HS36 and HS38 processors. It allows processor operation
at the following speeds:

* ARC HS34/HS36 - 100 MHz
* ARC HS38x2 (dual core) - 100 MHz

The ARC AXC003 CPU card contains 256 kByte of on-chip SRAM and features
1 GByte of DDR3-SDRAM. The software delivered as part of the ARC AXC003 CPU
Card includes pre-built SMP Linux image (plus the U-boot bootloader) and the
MQX RTOS in binary format. Bare metal and MQX RTOS device driver source code
for a subset of the peripherals and example applications. Code development
is made easy using the MetaWare Development Toolkit, MetaWare Lite tools
or the ARC GNU Tool Chain.
