## Known issues

### ARC Classic

1. Newlib's `libgloss` doesn't support RF16 configuration of ARC cores when building for nSIM with `-specs=nsim.specs`, see #231. Use `-specs=hl.specs` instead for RF 16 configurations.

2. Non-multilib toolchain doesn't contain `libgloss` libraries for nSIM and development boards, see #262.

3. `libcrypt.so.1` is not included in the toolchain (starting from glibc 2.38 `libcrypt.so.1` is not built by default and will be removed from glibc in the future), please use `libcrypt` implemented by external libraries such as [libxcrypt](https://github.com/besser82/libxcrypt) instead of relying on Glibc internal implementation.

4. Eclipse IDE for ARCompact does not support selecting `-specs=` options in project's configuration menu. Consider passing this options (e.g., `-specs=nsim.specs` for nSIM) in "ARC GNU Linker" field of projects configuration dialog (C/C++ Build -> Settings -> Top Settings -> ARC GNU Linker).

5. `arc-snps-elf-tcf-gcc` and `tcftool` are distribute as non-executables. Use chmod +x command to set correct rights for these binaries.

### ARC-V

1. Some complex combinations of `-march=` and `-mabi=` options may lead to unpredictable errors during compilation. Such issues are related to general support of RISC-V extensions in GCC. Refer [#610](https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/toolchain/issues/610) for details.

2. The size-optimized Newlib Nano configuration (used when `-specs=nano.specs` is passed to GCC) does not support `printf()` for `float` and `double` by default. Nano `printf()` is size-optimized and does not include support of `float` and `double`. If you need that feature, pass `-u _printf_float` to GCC when you compile your applications. This option picks up support of `float` and `double` for size optimized `printf()` on demand.

4. Using selective scheduler with a specific set of options may lead to incorrect code generation. Refer [Bug 118153](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=118153) for details.
