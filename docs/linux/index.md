# Embedded Linux Projects for ARC Processors

## Linux Kernel

![Logo Linux](images/logo-linux.jpg)

The Linux Kernel, with support for ARC Processors. Includes support for ARCv1
(ARC750, ARC770), ARCv2 (ARC HS38, ARC HS38x2 and ARC HS38x4) and ARCv3
(ARC HS5x/HS6x) architectures. Source code available from upstream Linux kernel
repositories at <https://kernel.org>.

You can find documentation pages related to Linux kernel on the sidebar for
the current section. Other useful resources:

## Automotive Grade Linux

![Logo Automotive Grade Linux](images/logo-automotive.png)

Automotive Grade Linux is a collaborative open source project that is bringing
together automakers, suppliers and technology companies to accelerate the
development and adoption of a fully open software stack for the connected car.
With Linux at its core, AGL is developing an open platform from the ground up
that can serve as the de facto industry standard to enable rapid development of
new features and technologies. This project contains required components and
instructions and build and run AGL on ARC HS Processors. A prebuilt
demonstration image for the ARC HSDK platform is also available.
