![Logo MLI](images/logo-mli.png){ width="200" }

The embARC Machine Learning Inference (embARC MLI) library consists of software
functions optimized for DSP-enhanced ARC EMxD and ARC HS4xD processors.
The primary purpose of this library is to enable developers to efficiently
implement and/or port data processing algorithms based on machine learning
principles for ARC Processors. The embARC MLI distribution is managed by
Synopsys for the community and all contributions are welcomed.
