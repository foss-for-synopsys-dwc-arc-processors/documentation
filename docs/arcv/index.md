# GNU toolchain for ARC-V targets

GNU toolchain for ARC-V targets supports all ARC-V targets:

* [Tuning GCC instruction scheduling](#tuning-scheduling) for RMX-100, RMX-500, RHX-100 and RPX-100.
* Includes optimized sets of libraries for basic profiles for RMX-100, RMX-500, RHX-100 and RPX-100.
* Enabling ARC-V caches on startup.

Because the ARC-V GNU toolchain is built on top of standard components such as GCC, Binutils, and GDB,
all functionality of these tools stays in place and can be studied in detail in the corresponding manuals:

* [GCC documentation](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/14.2.0/)
* [Binutils documentation](https://sourceware.org/binutils/docs-2.43/)
* [GDB documentation](https://www.sourceware.org/gdb/documentation/)
